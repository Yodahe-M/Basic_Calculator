# overview

This is a simple, basic calculator that performs the four fundamental calculations: addiction, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
I developed this application using the Kotlin language. The purpose of this calculator is to assist users in performing arithmetic operations
by allowing them to choose the desired operation and input two numbers for the calculation.
Once the user enters the numbers, the application provides the result of the selected operation. 
Additionally, there is error handling in place to manage situations where a user attempts to divide a number by zero, which is an invalid operation.
